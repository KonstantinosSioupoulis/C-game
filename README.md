# Cpp-game
This is a strategy game written in Cpp that is based on a library made by our teacher called SGG which you can find here (https://cgaueb.github.io/sgg/index.html). There are 2 teams of 4 players where each player has their own characteristics and the team that manages to kill all opponents wins.
